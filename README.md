# HackItAll Elimination Round

This is a code implementation of a vending machine designed to allow the sale
of Avira products to students. For this implementation we chose to use Python.

## Classes

The following classes were implemented in the design of this app:

* **Product**: defines the properties of each item on sale
	* *Name*: the get(*self*) and set(*self, name*) methods in this category
				set and return the name of a product
	* *Price*: this method category is split into a get(*self*) and a 
				set(*self, price*) method that update and retrieve the given
				price of a product
* **Cash**: defines the methods used in cash payments
	* On initialization of an object, a dictionary containing each type of 
	currency that can be used. This dictionary will be used to keep track of
	all the currency inserted into the machine
	* *insertMoney(self, amount)*: adds inserted currency to the dictionary
	* *getChange(self, currentcredit, totalcartvalue)*: gives back owed change
	* *getMoney(self)*: returns the total ammount of currency inserted
* **Card**: defines methods used for card payments
	* On initialization of an object, a preset card balance and pin are set up
	(this is done only for the purpose of this implementation)
	* *checkFunds(self, price)*: checks to determine if the selected items are 
	affordable based on card balance
	* *checkPin(sef, givepin)*: checks to see if inputted pin is correct
* **VendingMachine**: this class is the core of the machine; it is set up as a
	singleton class so there can only be one object of this type
	* On initialization, this class sets up all of the available products, creates a dictionary with the prices of each item as well as a dictionary
	with the number of products contained in the machine
	* *getCredit(self)*: returns credit available to the user
	* *getNo< product_name >(self)*: returns the existing amount for each
	product
	* *getPrice< product_name >(self)*: returns the price for each item
* **Button(object)**: this class defines a button object for use in UI
	* On initializition the button is place at it's respective coordinates on
	the screen, it's size is defined, it gets given a name and an image to
	display
	* *draw(self,screen)*: this method is called every frame to have the button
	redrawn
	* *event_handler(self, event)*: this method handles what happens when the
	button is clicked
* **PaymentButton(Button)**: this class defines the button type for the buttons
	used in selecting the payment methods
	* On initialization the same setup is performed as for the standard button 
	class defined above
	* *event_handler(self, event)*: this method handles what happens when the
	button is clicked
* **Text**: defines the label-style objects used to display text
	* On initialization the font style and size, text and position are set up
	* *draw(self, screen)*: this method is used to redraw and update the label
	every frame
* **PriceText(Text)**: this defines the labels that are used for displaying UI
	text
	* On initialization these labels have the same setup as defined in the 
	generic text label class 

* **CoinsText(Text)**: this defines a clickable label that is used to display 
	each increment of currency accepted
	* On initialization these labels use the same setup as defined in the
	generic text label class the only difference being that these posses a 
	value and are clickable
	* *event_handler(self,event)*: this method handles what happens when the 
	labels are clicked

* **TextButton(Text)**: this defines a clickable label for each product
	* On initialization these labels use the same setup as defined in the
	generic text label class the only difference being that these posses a 
	value and are clickable
	* *event_handler(self,event)*: this method handles what happens when the 
	labels are clicked

## Statistics

The way we chose to keep track of product sale statistics by storing the total 
amount of money accumulated in the vending machine and the revenue generated by
each transaction. This revenue is categorised by each product to allow Avira to
easily keep track of which product was the most favoured and which brought the
least profits.

All data is stored in a special file to allow for easy exporting and a plot 
creating tool was also implemented using the `matplotlib` library in Python.
This allows for easy visualisation of all data.

The following is an example of the way we display individual product statistics
